                <h3>Type of Pharmacists</h3>
                <p class="text-white">There are three main areas a pharmacist can work in: you can be a hospital
                    pharmacist, retail or community pharmacist, or industrial pharmacist.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Hospital pharmacists </strong> work closely with doctors and are responsible for the
                    ordering, quality testing, storing and security of drugs and medicines in hospitals. They must also
                    ensure an adequate supply of medicine.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Retail or community pharmacists</strong> supply prescribed and over-the-counter medicines to
                    the general public in a retail pharmacy (such as a local chemist), and give advice to customers on
                    the safe use of medicines and possible side effects.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Industrial pharmacists </strong>
                    work in pharmaceutical companies where they help to discover safe and effective new drugs, develop
                    them into effective medicines, and market the finished product to customers.<br></p>
